## GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

- [x] gcd(x,y) : it is the `greatest natural number` which `*divides both* x and y`, where x and y both are natural number.
    - gcd(24,18) = 6 {24 and 18 is divided by 6 which is the greatest number} 
- [x] lcm(x,y) : it is the `least natural number` which is `*divided by* both x and y`.
    - lcm(24,18) = 72 {72 is divided by both 24 and 18 which is the least number.}
