## Software Engineering:

- It is Systematic, disciplined, cost effective techniques for software development
    - Systematic: Following Step by Step Approach
    - Disciplined: We are following Rules.
- It is not relaed to how to code ?
- It is an Engineering approach to develop software.

- If you are following the approach it doesn't mean you are guranteed to be success, but the probability of success will be mor

1. Planning / Requirement Analysis
    - Communicate with the user
        - Meaningful Communication is Very Important
    - Identification of Risk
    - Senior Members
        - Customer jb apni requirement btata hai, to jo sunne vala hona chahiye vo senior hona chahiye, means an experienced person
        - Jisko smj mae aana chahiye ki client kehne ki kya koshish kr rha hai, and use implement kese krna hai
        - practically possible hai ya nhi, ya kitne limit tk possible kr skte hai
    - Ambiguity Problem
        - Customer nae ek requirement btayi and uske kai mtlb nikal skte hai, usko kehte hai ambiguity problem.

2. Defining and Analysis:
    - Documenting the product requirements and get approved from customer
    - SRS (Software Requiremetn Specification)

3. Design:
     - Product Architecture
     - DDS (Design Document Specification)
     - Best Architecture is Selected
    
4. Build/Development:
    - Code Generated
    - use compiler.interpreter,debugger
    - Best Suited Programming language is Selected.

5. Testing:
    - Subset of all stages in SDLC
    - Detecting, reporting, tracking, fixing and retesting
        - Potentional errors ko detect,report track krna , then fix krna
    - Till it reaches SRS quality standards

6. Deployment:
    - Releasing the S/W in market
    - Maintenance after deployment is conducted and it required Re-release in market.
