    In many-to-many mapping, an entity in E1 is associated with any number of entities in E2, and an entity in E2 is associated with any number of entities in E1.

    Example: Here,
    1. One student can enroll in any number (zero or more) of courses.
    2. One course can be enrolled by any number (zero or more) of students.

- **Many-to-One Cardinality**-
    In one-to-many mapping, an entity in E1 is associated with at most one entity in E2, and an entity in E2 is associated with any number of entities in E1.
