# OOPS

## Principles of OOP
1. Abstraction : Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction., Visible Outside - function, e.g. Telivision, we dont know how it work, just have button to change channels. Buttons-functions
2. Encapsulation : Data Hiding - Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. In TV , buttons are function and hidden part is data.
3. Inheritence : When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object
4. Polymorphism

Why Hiding Data ?
- its for avoiding misshandling , someone changes variable datatype like, its not for security.
