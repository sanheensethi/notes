# OOPS

# OOP's Object Oriented Programming System/Structure

Note: We can also say `oop` , object oriented programming

## 1. What is OOPS ?

- OOP's is a programming paradigm/methodology

> paradigm : kuch bhi kaam krne ka way or style. In real world - hr person paise kmana chata hai, so there are many ways youtube job etc., Development krte tym we have many ways ki particular task kese achieve krna hai, vo jo way hai ya style hai usko kehte hai, hum programming paradigm

> Paradigm : It can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task. 

- Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming langugae or also we can say, it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are avaliable to us following some appraoch

> Programming Paradigm is of many types

- Object Oriented paradigm
- Procedural paradigm
- Functional 
- Logical
- Structured

 - We do, Object Oriented Paradigm

> OOps bhi ek style hai jisse hum apni problems ko solve krte hai/ development krte hai

## 6 Main Piller of OOPs are

1. Class
2. Object & Methods
3. Inheritence
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulization

## Which languages are purely OOP : SamallTalk (First oops langugage)

Other `Java,CPP,C#,PHP,Python`

## Class :
- A class is a `blueprint` that `defines the variables` and `the methods` `common` to `all objects of a certain kind.`
- Class is not real world entitiy , it's just blueprint or prototype

- Class comming from calssification
- Categorize Everything
- If we talk about college , we can say that these students belong to computer science, so this is class of computer science, and these students are of electronics, so there's another class of electronics.
- So we are classifying based on the subject or course they are going for
- `Classification is based on the criteria that you are adopting`
- So, you are grouping set of students based on their course, so there's a class of computer science and electronics
- But you can see, both computer science and electronics are student only, so strudent is again a class.
- Now, Students and Employee are human beings, so again there is a classification. so Human is class
- Example : Animals,Birds,Vechiles,Furniture,Fruits
- Class ke andar objects hote hai, 
    - Animal : Dog,Cat
    - Birds : Sparrow,Peacock
    - Vechile : Car,Jeep

## Object : 
- an object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class.
- Car : Alto,Swift both are object of class Car
- class is defination and object is instance
- Example : Suppose civil engineer made a plan for the house, so, Then based on these plan there are many houses are constructed that follow the same design, So design is one and we have created many houses, so design is bassically a blueprint a class and houses are objects which ajapts the features from blueprint or you can say class
- Example : Making a design of fingerprint scanner, there is a circuit diagram, now, electronic enginner create multiple fingerprint scanner based on that design, so design is blueprint of fingerprint scanner i.e. class, and real world in which we ae trying our thumbs are objects, there can be multiple fingerprint scanner , it means there can be multiple objects of same class.

## Data Hiding - Realted to Encapsulation

## Principles of OOP
1. Abstraction : Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction., Visible Outside - function, e.g. Telivision, we dont know how it work, just have button to change channels. Buttons-functions
2. Encapsulation : Data Hiding - Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. In TV , buttons are function and hidden part is data.
3. Inheritence : When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object
4. Polymorphism

Why Hiding Data ?
- its for avoiding misshandling , someone changes variable datatype like, its not for security.
