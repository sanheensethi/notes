# Linear Algebra
- Data Representation.
- Identifying Linear Equation.
- Fundamental Block in machine learning algorithm.

### Matrix:
- Matrix can be used to represent samples with multiple attributes in compact form.
- Matrices can also be used to represent linear equations in compact and simple fashions.
- Linear algebra provides tools to understand and manipulate matrices to derive useful knowledge from data.

1. Usually matrices are used to store and represent the data on machines.
2. Matrix is a very natual approach for organizing data.
3. In General, data is organized in following fashion:
    - Rows represent samples.
    - Columns represent the values of the variables/attributes.
    - It is also possible to use rows for variables and columns for samples.
    - We will stick to rows as samples and columns as variables in further discussion.
