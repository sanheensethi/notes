# Binary Search Tree (BST)
 
## 1. Introduction

- L < N < R
- left nodes are smaller then root
- right nodes are greater then root
- Left Subtree is also BST
- Right Subtree is also BST

- Duplicates are not allowed in BST , but in some books it is given it's allowed in MIT's, but you want to insert dublicates, then
- L <= N < R
- or for dublicates , we can store (node,frequencey) in node.

## 2. Why BST ?

- Generally not in worst, Height of Binary Search Tree log_2 (N)
- Search in BT its worst is O(N)
- Search in BST its O(logN)
