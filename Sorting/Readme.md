# Sorting Techniques

> Criterion for Analysis

- Number of comparisons
- Number of swaps
- Adaptive
    - It means when the array is already in the sorted order thrn it shoulf take less time then that is called adaptive
- Stable
    - here stable eams eg- if we have an array (1 3 4 2 4 5) then after sorting it will become (1 2 3 4 4 5), here 4 comes two times , the first 4 will be the 1st 4 in the original array , means its sequence should not change
- Extra memory
    - some sorting algos require extra memory also
